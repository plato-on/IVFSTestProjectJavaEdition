# IVFSTestProjectJavaEdition
Hi guys!
This is the 9th version of my project

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78474479/174486481-f2e9008a-7a16-486a-82b3-654190407e9d.png)

My own goal was to make it C++ like realisation but with java-saved principals.
I think, this one would be the best of others, but i got some ideas for a next edition on the repo here:
https://github.com/plato-on/IVFSTestProjectPlusEdition

Note, that current JavaEdition works with buffers maxValue of Integer 2147483647 and with numbers/english-language-based files.
There are some ready checks in Check.java
Enjoy and thank you for fun!
