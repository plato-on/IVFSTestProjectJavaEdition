# TestProjectJavaEdition
Hi guys!
This is the 9th version of my project
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78474479/174485964-ff0b87d9-9df4-4edc-9530-37e0d4f8470e.png)
My own goal was to make it C++ like realisation but with java-saved principals.
I think, this one would be the best of others, but side i got some ideas for a next edition on the repo here:


Note, that current JavaEdition works with buffers maxValue of Integer 2147483647 and with numbers/english-language-based files.
There are some ready checks in Check.java
Enjoy and thank you for fun!
